Post anonymously to a Twitter account. 

## Front End

Angular.js app. It validates the user's humanity with a simple randomly generated math problem. It shows all tweets on the account in a side scrolling display.

## Back End

Connects to the Twitter API with [codebird-php](https://github.com/jublonet/codebird-php).

`submit.php` submits the tweet and `getTweets.php` returns all tweets on the account with a max capped at 3200.

# Thanks for taking a look

Any and all comments, suggestions and criticisms are more than welcome.

Best,

Willie
